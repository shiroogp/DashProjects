Version 0.8.1

API Breaks:
* None

Internal Changes:
* Change of DEBUG_LEVEL enum. It has been moved from ObdThread to obdLib. This should not affect anyone yet.

Functionality Changes:
* Addition of non-CAN mode 06. This is in pre-alpha, so it is not recommended to use it yet.
* Added 115200 baud, set default to 38400 (if no baud is specified)

New signals: 
void rawCommsMessage(QString msg);
	Called for every serial read or write. This is a QString representation of the exact data sent or recieved, including carrige returns, invalid characters, everything.
void debugMessage(QString msg, obdLib::DebugLevel lvl);
	Debugging messages. I've not yet converted all debug messages over from qDebug and printf to this, so it is unreliable at best.



Version: 0.8
Initial start of version tracking.
