Handling DuplicateOptionError in INI Parsing
When configparser (the standard Python INI parser) encounters the same option more than once in a section, it raises a DuplicateOptionError by default. You have two primary ways to work around this:
- Tell configparser to allow duplicates (last‚Äêwins).
- Preprocess or use a more tolerant parser to capture all duplicates.

1. Allow Duplicates with strict=False
Since Python 3.2, you can disable strict key-uniqueness checking. The last occurrence of a duplicated key will overwrite earlier ones.


2. Preprocess and Rename Duplicates
If you need to keep all values for repeated keys, you can preprocess the INI file and rename the duplicates before handing it to configparser. For example:
**    preprocess_ini.py
Use dedupe_and_load(path) in place of cfg.read(path) to capture every duplicate as a uniquely named key.
3. Use a More Tolerant Parser: configobj
 is a third-party library that by default collects duplicate keys into lists:

**Bash
    pip install configobj
**Python
    from configobj import ConfigObj

    cfg = ConfigObj('Core EFI 202103 .ini', list_values=True, duplicate_keys='list')
    # Now cfg['SettingGroups']['SettingGroup'] is a Python list of all occurrences.
From here you can iterate over cfg['SettingGroups']['SettingGroup'] directly.

Next Steps
- Decide whether you need all duplicates or just the final value.
- Update your ini_loader.py to use strict=False for simplicity, or the preprocessing approach if you need every entry.
- Re-run your loader against ecudefs/coreefi/Core EFI 202103 .ini to confirm the error is resolved.
