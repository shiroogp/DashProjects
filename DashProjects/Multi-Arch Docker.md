# Multi-Architecture Docker Images: A Comprehensive Guide

Multi-architecture (multi-arch) Docker images let you publish a single image reference that runs on different CPU platforms (ARMv6, ARMv7, ARM64, x86_64). This guide walks you step-by-step through enabling Buildx, registering QEMU, authoring a multi-stage Dockerfile, and publishing a unified multi-arch image.

---

## Overview

Dockerâ€™s Buildx plugin extends the `docker build` command with multi-architecture builds and advanced features like build caching and parallelism. By combining Buildx with QEMU emulation, you can compile ARM binaries on an x86_64 host (or vice versa) and push one image tag that works across Pi Zero, Pi 3/4, cloud servers, and more.

## Benefits of Multi-Arch Images

- Single image reference for all target platforms  
- Automated platform detection on `docker pull`  
- Simplified CI/CD pipelines without per-platform tags  
- Consistency across development, staging, and production

## Prerequisites

1. Docker Engine 20.10+ installed  
2. Experimental CLI features enabled (optional on newer Docker versions)  
3. Git (for Buildx and QEMU setup)

## Supported Platforms

| Platform        | CPU Architecture | Example Device           |
| --------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| linux/arm/v6    | ARMv6            | Raspberry Pi Zero (v1)   |
| linux/arm/v7    | ARMv7            | Raspberry Pi 2/3         |
| linux/arm64     | ARMv8            | Raspberry Pi 4/400       |
| linux/amd64     | x86_64           | Desktop / Cloud Server   |

## 1. Enable Buildx and Register QEMU

1. Install and start Docker Engine.  
2. Enable Buildx:
   ```bash
   docker buildx create --name multiarch-builder --use
   docker buildx inspect --bootstrap
